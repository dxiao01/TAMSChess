                TAMS Chess Club is a place for TAMS students to, well, play chess. We welcome players of all skill levels, from beginners to advanced, and even those who are just getting into the game. We hope that we can spark an enjoyment of chess in not only the TAMS community, but the wider Denton area through hosting chess nights at local venues. We also hold weekly practices/workshops and will be holding a TAMS Tournament!
